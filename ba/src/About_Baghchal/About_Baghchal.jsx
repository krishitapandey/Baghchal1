                        <p>Bagh Chal ('Tiger Game') is a 2-player abstract strategy game from Nepal.
                            This game is played on a 5Ã—5 point grid, like alquerque.
                            Pieces are positioned at the intersection of the lines
                            and not inside the areas delimited by them. Directions
                            of valid movement between these points are connected by
                            lines. The game play takes place in two phases. In the
                            first phase the goats are placed on the board while the tigers are moved
                            In the second phase both the goats and the tigers are moved. For the tigers
                            the objective is to "capture" five goats to win. Capturing is performed as in alquerque and draughts, by jumping over the goats, although capturing is not obligatory. The goats win by blocking all the tigers' legal moves. Bagh-Chal has many similarities to the Indian game Aadu puli attam (Lambs and Tigers game), though the board is different.</p></div>
